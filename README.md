# Queue Data Structure

## Description

This is a javascript implementation of a
[queue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue%28abstract_data_type%29)
data structure.

A queue data structure models the notion of 'First in First Out', or FIFO&mdash;
image the line at the grocery store.  The first item to be removed from a queue
is the first item placed in the queue.  Basically, the order in which items
are placed in the queue matters.
